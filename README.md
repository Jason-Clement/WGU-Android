# WGU-Android

This was a school project for building an Android application in Android Studio.
The app's purpose is to help students with tracking their classes, terms, and assessments.
I was not allowed to use any external ORM and I had to use Java.

The user experience for this app is absolutely dreadful. There is no way I would have
designed it this way, but I needed to meet specific requirements and I had no way
to dispute them.
